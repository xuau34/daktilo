L'après-midi, il y a beaucoup des gens pour voir le pièce ici. Ils sont étés très ennuyeux quand j'ai participé à une compétition informatique.

Et mon amis ne s'inquiétent pas pour la pièce après ce semestre. Ce m'inquiéte beaucoup.

Je ne veux pas parler beaucoup de moi.

Donc, bon soir.

I watched the animation, One Piece, all the day. Leave those homeworks and my goal. And keep the mood down in the show. But, this still can't pull me back in the safe house. I'm still a naughty girl, loving watching someone else doing their favorite frankly. Why can't I be myself?

Today, I participated in a contest in codeforce, and I only got three ACs. And the forth, maybe with the fifth after, is gotten by refering the codes of another person. How shame am I! And I told my boyfriend about the contest, he told me thinking faster, kicking them off quicklier, which is what makes me feel brethless and shame enough to show myself off(?). I've tried so hard, and that's all I got. How irony.

Another day comes. And I keep things here, including of myself, begging an another nightmare. Maybe~

My neighbor is so annoying. Zz

Good night! I have to watch those animations~
