J'ai décidée de participer à A1 ce qu'est l'examen de français. Le test, j'ai fait heir soir, est très mauvais. Et je n'ai pas le courage de parler plus.

Bon soir.

I must get another problem of speaking France from the last night.

Speaking of the terrible thing. This noon, I bought my lunch, and an old man came buying his lunch, too. But he checked for it first. And when the food was cooked, I took it right away, with surprising after one minute about that man bought the same lunch as mine. I was so embarrased then.

Whatever, I have tomorrow to struggle. So, I won't waste my tongue too much. I need to leave some time for playing cube escape, an app in android.

Good night.
