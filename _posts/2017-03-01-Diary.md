Non, je ne peux rien de parler.

Bon soir.

I got a very bright start today. But I fell in the middle way with emotional problem, the delf dalf problem and the problem that I still don't have no idea communicating with others. Well.. So like Holmes but without the amazing brain.

Now, the biggest problem is the exam of France. I have finished a simulation exam of A1 scoring twenty-nine of fifty. That's not the worse. It's that I thought I might have the ability to reach the class of B1 with all the hard work of these two years and end in only A1.

No matter what I've chosen, I need to keep it.

So, how to choose between my ability and hopes?

Sleeping thinking of it, good night!
